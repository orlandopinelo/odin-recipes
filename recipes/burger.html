    <h1>Bacon, Egg, and Avocado Burgers</h1>
    <p>If you're craving a really juicy, delicious burger that's packed with flavor and textures then this egg-topped burger is the burger for you! When you bite into this burger the burst of the egg yolk and the creaminess of the avocado with the crunchiness of the bacon sends this burger over the edge.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>  
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons salted butter, softened</li>
        <li>4 hamburger buns, split</li>
        <li>8 slices thick-cut bacon</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds lean ground beef</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon steak seasoning</li>
        <li>4 slices Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>4 large lettuce leaves</li>
        <li>½ red onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 avocados - peeled, pitted, and thinly sliced</li>


    </ul>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>  
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Butter each half of hamburger buns.</li>
        <li>Place bacon in a heavy skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until crisp, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Set the skillet aside, reserving grease.</li>
        <li>Mix ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, and steak seasoning together in a large bowl; do not overmix. Form into 4 patties. Make a thumbprint in the middle of each patty to keep it from shrinking as it cooks.</li>
        <li>Grill patties on the preheated grill until preferred doneness, about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C). Top each burger with 2 slices bacon and a Cheddar cheese slice; close the grill lid until cheese is melted, about 1 minute. Remove patties from the grill.</li>
        <li>Place buns on the grill, buttered-side down, and cook until browned, about 1 minute. Remove from the grill. Place 1 patty on the bottom half of each bun.</li>
        <li>Reheat the bacon grease in the skillet over medium-high heat. Crack eggs into the hot skillet and fry until whites are cooked but yolk is still runny, about 4 minutes. Immediately place 1 egg on top of each patty. Top with lettuce, onion, avocado, and remaining buns.</li>
    </ol>
